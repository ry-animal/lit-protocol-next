## Q1

\_isBalanceWithinThreshold(uint256 balance):
This function checks if a given balance is within the threshold limit. It calculates a lower bound based on totalStakedAssets and rebalanceThreshold, then returns true if the balance is greater than or equal to this lower bound.

\_updateBalance():
This internal function updates the totalAssets of the contract by fetching the balance of the STABLECOIN token for the contract's address.

\_updateStakedBalance(uint256 amount, uint256 add):
This function updates the totalStakedAssets. If add is 1, it adds the amount to totalStakedAssets; otherwise, it subtracts the amount.

\_updateAvailableAssets():
This function updates the availableAssets and minAssetBalance based on the current totalAssets, totalStakedAssets, and rebalanceThreshold. It calculates the needed liquidity and adjusts availableAssets accordingly.

Order -
\_updateBalance() : updated for new deposits
\_updateStakedBalance(amount, 1) : increase new staked amt
\_updateAvailableAssets() : recalculated based on total and staked balances

## Q2

Conditions for a potential attack:

- The attacker needs to have permission to call the aggregate() function.
- The contract should not have proper access controls or validation on the targets and data parameters.

Potential attack scenario:
An attacker could use this function to execute arbitrary calls to any contract address, potentially including:

- Calling sensitive functions on other contracts.
- Transferring tokens or ETH from the contract to the attacker's address.
- Manipulating state variables in other contracts.
- Performing flash loan attacks by batching multiple operations.

Types of funds at risk:

- Any ETH stored in the contract.
- Any ERC20 tokens that the contract has approval to spend.
- Any assets controlled by contracts that this contract has permission to interact with.

To mitigate these risks, it's crucial to implement strict access controls, validate target addresses,
and carefully review the data being passed to this function.
Additionally, using a whitelist of allowed target addresses and function signatures could significantly reduce
the attack surface.

## Q3

Permit2, developed by Uniswap, offers several improvements over traditional ERC20 allowances. Let's break down its features, benefits, and potential risks:

Differences from normal ERC20 allowances:

1. Signature-based approvals: Permit2 uses EIP-712 signatures for approvals, allowing users to grant permissions without an on-chain transaction.

2. Time-bound permissions: Approvals can have expiration times, limiting the window of vulnerability.

3. Allowance management: Users can set specific allowance amounts for different spenders and tokens in a single operation.

4. Batched operations: Permit2 enables combining multiple token approvals and transfers in a single transaction.

Usefulness in multi-step transactions:

1. Gas efficiency: By batching operations, it reduces the number of separate transactions needed for complex operations.

2. Improved UX: Users can approve and execute multi-step operations in a single transaction, streamlining the process.

3. Flexibility: It allows for more complex and customized token interaction patterns without multiple approval steps.

Why Permit2 is "safer" than regular allowances:

1. Time-limited approvals: Reduces the risk window compared to indefinite traditional allowances.

2. Granular control: Users can set specific allowances for different spenders and tokens, minimizing exposure.

3. No need for "infinite" approvals: Users don't need to set unnecessarily high allowances for protocols to function.

4. Signature-based: Approvals can be granted off-chain, reducing on-chain footprint and potential attack surface.

Potential risks with Permit2:

1. Signature reuse: If signatures are not properly invalidated after use, they could potentially be reused.

2. Phishing attacks: Users might be tricked into signing malicious permissions.

3. Smart contract vulnerabilities: As with any smart contract, undiscovered bugs could lead to exploits.

4. Centralization risk: Reliance on a single contract (Permit2) could create a central point of failure if compromised.

5. User error: Complex permissions might confuse users, leading to unintended approvals.

6. Front-running: In some scenarios, signed permissions could be front-run before their intended use.

While Permit2 offers significant improvements in safety and flexibility over traditional ERC20 allowances, users and developers should remain vigilant and understand the system thoroughly to mitigate potential risks.
